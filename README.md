      Age: 30
      Address: 123 Main St, Apt #5
      ```

### Print Statements

9. **Basic Print Statement**
    - Write a print statement that outputs the string `Hello, Python!`.

10. **Print with Variables**
    - Use the following variables and a print statement to output `My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.`:
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    age = 25
    ```

11. **String Concatenation**
    - Concatenate the following strings and print the result:
    ```python
    str1 = "Python "
    str2 = "is "
    str3 = "awesome!"
    ```

12. **Formatted Strings**
    - Use an f-string to print `The value of pi is approximately 3.14`.

13. **Old-style String Formatting**
    - Use the `%` operator to print `The value of pi is approximately 3.14`.

14. **Print with Separator and End**

15. **Advanced Print Formatting**

      | Charlie| 35  | UK        |
      ```
